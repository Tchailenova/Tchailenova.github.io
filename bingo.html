      <p>I did end up adding <strong>Excited for Coffee</strong> for an even 25 items, and disabled the free space, but all the rest are from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@vidiot5533">vidiot5533</a>'s comment on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahFIVYCpds&list=PLhU3dB8ByRLAqRI_OwhIVxK0K4prwsPD6&index=51">Tango's 2nd VOD from a Hermitcraft Stream Weekend</a>

      <p>Borrowed a few ideas from the TCG cards for some hermits, and a few ideas from existing bingobaker cards, but most of these came outta my own brain.
      <br>There are 75 items, so it should have good replay value until the season shifts gears and the Hermits get into mid-game stuff. Hopefully I'll have some good ideas suitable for the next phase by the time it rolls around!</p>
