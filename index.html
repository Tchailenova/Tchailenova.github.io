      <h3>Silly Quote Wall</h3>

      <p>This thing called "knowledge" is not enough for me
        <br>I must have <strong>understanding</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>A deeper relationship with information leads to a more rewarding life, more worth living.</p>

      <p>The time for running away is Over; it is time to run Toward the things worth Living For.</p>

      <p>No more stagnation in safety; that's no way to live.</p>

      <p>Bear true witness to thine own potential and fulfill your Dreams.</p>

      <p>Sometimes, full commitment to a stupid idea comes out with some of the best [results] ... If you half-commit to a stupid idea, then it's bad - the whole thing's just rubbish. Whereas if you fully commit to a stupid idea, then it ends up being good.

      <p>I genuinely believe that all humans are absolutely super creative and I think sometimes people get caught up in maybe the aesthetics of a creative person [...], or the idea that you have to [be in a certain place] [...], I don't think that's the case at all. Everyone has the capacity to be creative, and I think sharing that actually the creative process does involve pain helps people realize that they are capable of creativity. This is the universal experience: that creativity does come with some pain.

      <p>The universal experience [with creativity] is doubting yourself, and struggling with it, and sitting with it, and then progressing, & getting better.

      <p>If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.

      <h4>Heartfelt acknowledgements to my family, and also:</h4>
      <p>for those who inspired me to chase my dream of being a content creator, even though I'm sure none of them are even remotely aware of the impact they've had on the course of my life.
      <br>Once I got the inkling that I might want to do this thing, I started seeking (and noticing serendipitous) advice from a lot of creators who I admired. Chief among them are: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@tangoteklp">TangoTek</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@impulsesv">impulseSV</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@mcskizzleman">Skizzleman</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@thatmumbojumbo">MumboJumbo</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@bekahart">A Brush with Bekah</a>.
