      <h3>Pithy Quote Wall</h3>
      <p>This thing called "knowledge" is not enough for me
        <br>I must have <strong>understanding</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>A deeper relationship with information leads to a more rewarding life, more worth living.</p>

      <p>The time for running away is Over; it is time to run Toward the things worth Living For.</p>

      <p>No more stagnation in safety; that's no way to live.</p>

      <p>Bear true witness to thine own potential and fulfill your Dreams.</p>

      <p>If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.
        <br><sup>-Sun Tzu, The Art of War</sup>
      </p>

      <p>You can't cling to a mistake simply because you spent a lot of time making it.
        <br><sup>-Heart of Aspen</sup>
      </p>

      <p><em>Mercy</em> <sub>[to a villain]</sub> cannot come at a cost to that villains <em>victims.</em>
