      <sup><em>Lessons we've learned while Painting our Kitchen Cabinets</em></sup>

    <p><em>Why</em> are we doing this ourselves? We initially hired a professional, but he produced insufficiently beautiful work and then ghosted us when we tried to get him to return in order to correct his errors and collect the other half of his pay.</p>
    So here we are (many months later), learning painful lessons and taking the long and scenic route to a kitchen we will be proud of.
    <br>
    <p><strong>Steps in the Process</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>sand the boards</li>
        <li>fill low spots with putty</li>
        <li>sand the putty smooth</li>
        <li>prime any places of exposed wood</li>
        <li>check the piece for imperfections</li>
        <li>sand if necessary</li>
        <li>clean the board of dust and oils</li>
        <li>store in the covered staging area until a whole batch is ready</li>
        <li>paint the batch (taking out of staging area and putting them back one-at-a-time)</li>
        <li>store in covered staging area and let dry</li>
        <li>check the piece for imperfections and color coverage</li>
        <li>begin again from the top as necessary</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>TIPS</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>good lighting is very beneficial in the sanding process</li>
        <li>soft long-bristle brush for brushing off sanding dust</li>
        <li>make use of some wet sand occasionally</li>
        <li>use green soap (in a spray bottle) to get off the stubborn dust and lint</li>
        <li>mineral spirits to get off the oils from skin</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Structures to Have</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>painting box - we are painting inside, with a paint gun, and thus it was necessary to protect our home from overspray and particulate</li>
        <li>covered staging area - useful for <strong>intermediary staging</strong> between <em>sanding</em> steps and as a place to <em>dry the paint</em></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Protect the boards from moisture, humidity, and drastic temperature differentials. Otherwise, the boards will warp and the joints will swell (at different rates) and cause ridges where a piece was once perfectly smooth, level, and square.</p>
    <p>Wet wood swells and the grain structure is highlighted. Paint that has water content will cause the wood grain to rise during the process of painting unless there is a layer of primer sealing the wood from the paint. <sup>so be sure to completely cover the board in primer!</sup></p>
    
    <h4>Troubleshooting</h4>
    <p>Many times we've encountered problems with the finish: scratches, swirls, bubbles, lint, dust, paint spatter, drips, divots, etc. Some of these are problems with paint application, some of these are problems with board-prep, some of these are problems with contaminants during the drying window.</p>
    <p>Speed and number of passes with the paint gun will affect your finish, and how quickly the paint dries. Test this for your desired results with a handful of numbered test-boards and good notetaking to document the variables which produced your desired results.</p>
    <p>The grit-number of the sanding paper will also affect your finish and some deeper scratches may not be adequately filled in (necessitating a repeat of the sanding and painting process), and some finer scratches might well <em>easily</em> get filled in by the paint application (and thus smoothing them out during sanding is a waste of time - sanding is not a brief step!)</p>
    <p>Dust and lint are caused both by insufficient pre-paint prep (cleansing the board adequately) as well as drying-window protection. We found it beneficial to close nearby A/C vents to diminish air currents, vacuum the nearby area to eliminate our footsteps from stirring dust into the air, and constructing the aforementioned Covered Staging Area (which eliminates a great deal coincidental particulate from the equation).
        <br>It should <em>not</em> be necessary to construct a bubble-boy enclosure for painting and drying, but we have gotten fairly close over the course of many months of tweaking and improving our setup.</p>
